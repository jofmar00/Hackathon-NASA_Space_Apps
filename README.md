## Content of the project

-  The project consists of a planet visualizer which represents the 10 most habitable planets ordered based on a filter that the user can change.
-  In the default configuration, if you press the diary button on the planets 1, 2 and 4 an AI will start to talk to you like it was a human living on the planet clicked. The idea is to represent how a human would live in a distant future, when the humans would have colonized the planet, indicating the pros and the difficulties encountered there.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend** Angular
- **Backend** Java + Spring.
  
The OpenAI API was also used for generating the texts of the logbook and also use to generate the audio of it.
